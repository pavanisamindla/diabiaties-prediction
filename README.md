#  Mellitus - MLOps
Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning with an End-to-End MLOps Pipeline

PROJECT OVERVIEW

Diabetes affects over 500 million people globally, making early detection critical to prevent complications like heart disease and kidney failure. This project builds a machine learning model to predict diabetes risk using key health metrics—blood glucose, BMI, age, insulin, and more—from  _____ dataset.

"Mellitus MLOps" is an intelligent system designed to:


- Predict diabetes risk using machine learning on CDC BRFSS (Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System) health indicators dataset (70k+ samples)  
- Classify patients into diabetic/non-diabetic categories with 77-85% accuracy
- Automate end-to-end MLOps (Machine Learning Operations) pipeline for training, deployment, and monitoring
- Enable scalable real-time predictions via FastAPI + Docker deployment
